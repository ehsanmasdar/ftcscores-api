# FTCScores API

This is the backend used to power FTCScores, a platform for aggregating match results for the [First Tech Challenge](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc) active from 2016-2022.

We're not maintaing this code anymore, but hope it is helpful to inspire future efforts! To everyone that used FTCScores, thanks for 7 seasons of awesome robots.
